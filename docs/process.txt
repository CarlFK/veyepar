preshow:
- Decide on who is responcible for the titles and other metadata.
- Decide what the definitive data store for the schedule is. (conference website, an offline spread sheet, a cork board in an office...)
- Decide how release aggrements will be managed.
- Decide how to sync the above data sources with veyepar's db. (right answer: conf web site db is definitive, there is an api, hack addeps.py to fit it)
- Create title slide template.svg.
- create title png's, send to conf chair for approval. (Are all logo plaement sponsership aggreements satified?)
- email pngs to presenters.  (this will expose problems when there is time to fix)

1. generate title slides, email to presenters for review
 - this double checks lots of things and has resulted in replies such as
"I didn't know I was speaking"
"I didn't know I was being recorded"
"Can you add my co-presenter's name?"


- destinations: youtube, mirror, physical media, richard, etc.  collect auth.
Showtime:
- print recording sheets and intro check list.
- record talks. Make sure clocks are accurate.  Files will need to be such that the location, start time and durration can be determined.

move files to encoding file server, add to db, create preview and visulations.
