# notes to review when setting up production systems

tune2fs - disable fsck on boot.  maybe.  it took 45 min in 2009 to fsck a 200g ext2 box.  I use ext4 now, so maybe not a problem 

nfs server:
vi /etc/exports
/video  10.0.0.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,async,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=0)

nfs client:
sudo vi /etc/fstab
ve:/video /video nfs noauto,rw,nfsvers=3 0 0

stare at screen, don't leave room, don't use your phone, watch videos before
overview of good video: 
 switch to slide, read, switch back to presenter
 use pnp when the fonts are big,
 or so to let the viewer know the slide hasn't changed
 it is easier for people to understand what a presenter is saying when they can see the body language.  especially for people who are not native.

setup: postgresql install/config.  nfs install/config, nginx...

install ssh keys when sshd is on default port
ssh-copy-id "-p 222 veyepar@nextdayvideo.com"

 mkfs.ext4 -L disk25 -O sparse_super,extent,uninit_bg -E lazy_itable_init=1 -m 0 /dev/abc

 /etc/default/rcS and change 'fsckfix' to yes
that tells it to shut up and do whatever without prompting you

bios: 
  don't stop on error
  pxe enabled on nic
  HD first boot device
