some things I am interested in:
- Are there any audio settings I might care about in the menu system?
- 720p out the hdmi port
- save/load the config from an SD card.
- no auto focus
- image gain
- white balance (I hold the back of the recording sheets (white paper)
in front of the camera)
- setting clock from an external time source plugged into ???
    (I don't need this for PyOhio, but I would like to know how to do it.
       The dvx 100 had this, I'm guessing these do too.)


Here is the one thing I do have:

Audio:
p 48
CH1 line
CH2 INT
Input 1/2 (phantom power) Off
Audio control knobs to 8
Input 1/2 (level, near XLR) Line
PA output into camera input 1
