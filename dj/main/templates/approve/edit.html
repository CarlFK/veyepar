<p>This talk needs a human to do a little work, likely under 5-10 minutes. 
or much more if you allow your pefection-izm to get the best of you.</p>
<p><strong>Follow this link to do the work: <a href="{% url guest_episode_review show_slug=episode.show.slug episode_slug=episode.slug edit_key=episode.edit_key %}">{{episode.name}}</a></strong></p>

<p>BTW, allowing the presenter to work on their talk is a new feature.
Use your good judgement and tell the list about problems, or open an issue at
