client checklist:
  release on talk submission
  data driven schedule, api (json)
  AV - audio
  slide show for between talks
  title slide for videos
  room access times

dvswitch:
  everything: default host/port
  dvsource-dvgrab - save unmixed stream
  dvsink-file - default file name: yyyy-mm-ddd/hh_mm_ss.i.dv

Show twinpact feed on slave display.
  note: slave display is also used to play a sponsor slide roll between talks.

veyepar:

  chrome - figure out file formats 
  how to keep it from being so agressive about buffering if Play isn't hit 

  store images of recording sheets
  next/prev (match recording sheet: same room/day)
  split long talk (tutorials) into parts.
  error handeling:
      log error, continue with next episode. 
      encode errors:   
        inkscape svg/png fail
        input files missing
        encoder fail
      webm parameters

  command line parameter to set cfg file.
    give test script its own cfg

  upload category - needs default

  upload to youtube
     use testing server for testing
     https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_testing
     delete old when replaced by new encode.

  upload in draft state:
      it is not meant for public viewing yet.
      there is no security blocking access
      if you have the URL, you can view it
      presenters will be mailed the URL, they can pass it on if they want.
      at some point we will want everone to see it, the we flip from draft to public
     
      YouTube: access control settings - needs to be implemnted.
      archive: not sure there is a UI for people to use, so dooesn't matter  
      richard: state:2 api is broken.


encoding:
  soften jump cuts
  create list of cut times relitive to start of final video
     - mainly used for Lighting talks to index each talk
  credits - hold for a few seconds at end.
  channel_copy - document and verify current behaviour
  

model:

dvswitch process management:
  bug people:
  Tim A to fix Kill button
  Ryan V 
     get scripts propperly checked into veyepr repo
     make sure his scripts to use _ in dv filenames

for unit tests:
  get sphinx or some such speach recognition packaged and in a PPA
    sphinx2-bin fell out of the ubuntu repos due to not being maintained.
    state of the art is not a requirement
    it just needs to recognize a simple phrase, like
       "go forward 10 meeters"   
    which gets encoded and demuxed back out 
    to make sure the encoder didn't muck it up.
    

Transcriptions
    Need a place to host transcriptions
    mix transcriptions with video for sub titling
