  dvsink-file - default file name: yyyy-mm-ddd/hh_mm_ss.i.dv

Show twinpact feed on slave display.
  note: slave display is also used to play a sponsor slide roll between talks.

veyepar:

  chrome doesn't play ogv. figure out what file formats to use for thumbs.  maybe now it does.
  how to keep it from being so agressive about buffering if Play isn't hit 

  store images of recording sheets
  next/prev (match recording sheet: same room/day)
  split long talk (tutorials) into parts.

  upload category - needs default, currently hardcoded to "Education"

  upload to youtube
     use testing server for testing
     https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_testing
     delete old version when replaced by new encode.
     invalid tags = fail and loop forever.

  state - need something to handle Canceled talks, breaks, etc.  
    disposition?  

  upload in draft state:
      it is not meant for public viewing yet.
      there is no security blocking access
      if you have the URL, you can view it
      presenters will be mailed the URL, they can pass it on if they want.
      at some point we will want everone to see it, the we flip from draft to public
     
      YouTube: access control settings - needs to be implemnted.
      archive: not sure there is a UI for people to use, so dooesn't matter  
      richard: 
        state:2 api is broken.
        html-atize desceription.

dvswitch process management:
  Ryan V 
     get scripts propperly checked into veyepr repo
     make sure his scripts to use _ in dv filenames

for unit tests:
  get sphinx or some such speach recognition packaged and in a PPA
    sphinx2-bin fell out of the ubuntu repos due to not being maintained.
    state of the art is not a requirement
    it just needs to recognize a simple phrase, like
       "go forward 10 meeters"   
    which gets encoded and demuxed back out 
    to make sure the encoder didn't muck it up.
