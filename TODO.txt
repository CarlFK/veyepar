veyepar:

  talk setup checklist- 
     laptop sound check
     confirm talk title
     ask presenter how they prounounce their name 
     ask audiance for a remote monitor (for IRC)

  move state data def from models.py to initial_data.json fixture.
     use state table, not a constant 

  episode.html save.. 
     UI to show user it got saved.
        "saved" page, 1 sec redirect back to episode?
        js to say "saved" that goes away in 5 seconds?
        js to say "saved/dirty" if there are outstanding edits?

  next/prev (match recording sheet: same room/day)

  split long talk (tutorials) into parts.

  error handling:
      encode and uploads nead attention
      log error, continue with next episode. 
      encode errors:   
        inkscape svg/png fail
        input files missing
        encoder fail

  command line parameter to set cfg file.
    option to disable reading config (tests should not read config)
    give test script its own cfg

  upload category - 
     needs default, currently hardcoded to "Education"

  youtube:
     use testing server for testing
     https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_testing
     delete old version when replaced by new encode.
     don't re-upload the same video (causes duplicate video error)
     # invalid tags cause fail and loop forever - fix this. 
         (fixed by not setting tags)
     
  state - need something to handle Canceled talks, breaks, etc.  
    disposition?  
    priority?

  state - mk_titles, email_titles ?
     (currently are done outside of the formal workflow steps, so hard to fix one and re-do)   
  state - really needs something new. like a bunch of "completed" flags.

  flag - do not overwrite when syncing with conf db - 
    this is to handle when I know better than the conference data.

  tweet hashtag - client or show or both?
  pyvideo.org category - client or show or both?
  (are these two the same thing?)

      richard: 
        reference back to veyepar page (hidden to public)
        reference to conference site page (for slides)
      
   move show.schedule_url to client.
    
   Stop - make it work again - 
     I think it is a buffering problem - 
     the code needs to poll the db, not look at the local cashed value

   zip title svg and images
      http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/inkscape/trunk/view/head:/share/extensions/svg_and_media_zip_output.py#L208
      meh, just include all the images in the svg.

encoding:
  remove global -dv-format setting 
  encode shorter talks first so they can get started uploading sooner.
  soften jump cuts - If end+start is not back to back, fade to black and back up.
  
  auto-speed up your videos to 1.25x speed as an additional optional feature
  no.

slugify talk titles- 
  truncate on word boundary when over X chars.

model:
  
  episode:

  child table of destination hosts (youtube, archive.org, mirror...)

  child table of output files
    mp4, ogv, mp3, facc...
    text: irc logs, transcript, tweets
    md5sum of file, and or that other thing that rackspace cdn uses
    datetime encoded
    
    grandchild of uploaded to urls?
    datetime uploaded
    track when deleted?  

  Once uploaded to a file sharing host,  (archive, rax, mirror...)
    use a cloud process to read from it and write to youtube so
    that the video file only goes across local connection once.

option to pick transport: popen(rsync...) or rax_uploader 
manage cloud storage:  
  png/svg for preview
  ogv/webm for remote editing
  audio_image for remote diagnostics 
  final encode for archive

process to check if a file is avalible for public viewing:
  (neither of these is a real problem, so low priority)
  youtube - "still processing, check again later."
  rsync or such, conjob or human processes that veyepar doesn't know about
    

  change duration from "hh:mm:ss" to float(sec)
  
  BucketID / Richard Category
    Sometimes this is per client, sometimes per show.
    thought: one field in each, if Show else look to client.

wallpaper 
  logos:
    NextDayVideo, 
    Linux, DVswitch, Python, Django, MLT


recording sheets:
  hostname:____
  add date/time to "Replace batteries" 
  add start-end time to header 
    (to help know how long the day is, 
      and help keep track of what the last sheet is.)

for unit tests:
  get sphinx or some such speach recognition packaged and in a PPA
    sphinx2-bin fell out of the ubuntu repos due to not being maintained.
    state of the art is not a requirement
    it just needs to recognize a simple phrase, like
       "go forward 10 meters"   
    which gets encoded and demuxed back out 
    to make sure the encoder didn't muck it up.
    

Transcriptions
    Need a place to host transcriptions
    mix transcriptions with video for sub titling 
    aurora .. um..  that's all I got.

OCR - http://software-carpentry.org

    flag for odd audio (like missing or very low)
    DD - "There is a new audiolevel filter. See output of melt -query filter=audiolevel"

ponder and debate cred management.
