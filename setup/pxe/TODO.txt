1. change default IP block to something less likely to conflict with internet connection (192.168.0.x being the most likely)

2. run an install, parse squid logs for URLs, make a file of URLs,
make a script that just reads them to warm up a fresh cache. This will be quicker than runing a full install.  Used when the installs are done witout a bordband connection: take the server to somewhere with a good connection, warm up cache, move server back to the Internet deseart. 

3. split out ddns setup.  people want that without the pxe and carl's install scripts.

4. nfs mounts for server:/Video or something.
